This project consists of the following bits and pieces:

  * A proposed specification to add support for embedded color image
    glyphs in OpenType fonts,

  * A tool called emoji-builder.py, to embed a set of PNG images into
    an existing fonts,

  * Two sets of sample PNG images for A-Z characters and sample font
    sources: FruityGirl and Funkster.  When combined using
    emoji-builder.py, these result in color fonts under this
    specification.

  * Scripts to build a real color emoji font out of the Open Source
    PhantomOpenEmoji images.
